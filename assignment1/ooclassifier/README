Assignment #1: Object-Oriented Classifier

Description

ooclassifier.py contains an object-oriented classification algorithm that has the ability to obtain its own frequency-based classification targets. Additionally, it is capable of performing folding cross-validation. 

ooclassifier.py performs preprocessing on a given text file that is either pipelined or entered manually into input. The preprocessing can be disabled via an optional mode parameter. It then searches for user-provided classification targets but this can be overwritten via selecting classification targets based on frequency.

ooclassifier.py is a self contained program that may be ran from the command line. However, it is important to note full functionality is available by importing classes within ooclassifier.py

Requirements 

The input text is expected to be pipelined into the command line program execution, or typed into a line during the program execution

The program expects an EOF signal at the end of input

The provided text must follow the syntax of input processing. Classification targets are identified via certain text patterns.

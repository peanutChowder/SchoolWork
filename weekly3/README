Weekly Exercise 2: Word Frequency
####################################################
Description

freq.py is a self-containing file in which the appropriate functions will be called from the main function (i.e. Call the file itself and do not import functions separately). 

The purpose of freq.py is to obtain a word count of every unique word, as well as determining a word count ratio. The word count ratio ranges from 0-1 and represents the word count of a unique word divided by the file's total word count. The file is to be called with a text file in the same directory containing the desired words to be analyzed. 

The program will output the results in the format of [word] [word_count] [word_count_ratio], organized alphabetically, to a file with the same name suffixed with ".out".

Requirements 

The input text file is expected to be in the same directory as that of freq.py
	- if the input file is in a different directory, the program will output an error message and exit

The program does not account for punctuation and other adjacent characters
	- e.g. within the sentence "hello, my name is", "hello," will be recognized as a word despite the comma not being part of the word hello
	- any sequence of adjacent characters will be recognized as a word

Weekly Exercise 4: Text Preprocessor 
####################################################
Description

preprocessor.py is a self contained program that must be run from the command line with the format 'python3 preprocessor.py [mode]', where mode is an optional parameter. 

The program performs preprocessing by taking in via input() a space delimited line of words. The words are converted to lowercase, then any symbolic characters (including punctuation) are removed. 
Additionally, any numbers are removed from words unless the word itself is only composed of numeric digits. Finally, if the word is a stopword, it is removed altogether. The list of stopwords is
hardcoded into the preprocessor.py file. 

The program has 3 options where symbol removal, number removal, or stopword removal can be disabled.

Requirements 

The input text is expected to be pipelined into the command line program execution, or typed into a line during the program execution

The program cannot deal with multiline strings
	- words are expected to be inputted via a single line
	- words are also expected to be split by a space

Modes must be typed exactly as specified following the program call
	- modes are case and space sensitive
